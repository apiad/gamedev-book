# Game Development for Computer Scientists

This repository holds the LaTeX source files and related sample code for a book on game development topics.
The objective of this book is to provide a unified view of game development, under the assumption that
the reader has knowledge of computer science topics, such as algorithms, data structures, artificial intelligence,
basic algebra, computer geometry, and other topics usually taught in CS majors. 

The book is accompanied by a Unity project with lots of sample codes for many of the concepts and techniques
presented. We choosed Unity because we believe that right now, all other things being equal, it is the tool
of choice for new game projects, specially in small teams with few resources. Throughout the book we
present all the topics as general as possible, highlighting the theoretical foundations and providing
ideas on how to implement them yourself. Then we use the appropiate Unity concepts (when they exist) to
illustrate the usage of such concepts in a realistic scenario.

## Content

This is a non-exhaustive list of the content we pretend to include in the book:

* Game mechanics
* Difficulty, learning curves, and engagement
* 2D and 3D graphics
* Physics-based animation
* Game AI
* Procedural content generation
* Optimization and performance tips
* Publishing and marketting

## Contributing

Every contribution is very much appreciated, anything from fixing a comma or mispelling to correcting
source code or writing new demos, and even whole new chapters. We prefer to use the Github fork model
for contributions, so please fork the project, do your changes, and submit a pull request. Issues
are also appreciated, so if you discover an error, even if you cannot fix it, please submit the 
corresponding issue with as much info as possible of how to reproduce the error.

While we appreciate and encourage all forms of contribution, if you intend to submit a large
modification (such as writing a new demo, or a new section or chapter), we would appreciate
if you submit an issue first. The reason for this is that we want to maintain as much as possible
a unified language and style (both in the book and the sample source code), and we would like
to discuss first with you just to make sure we agree on the basic approach. This is just to ensure
that your contribution helps as much as possible.

If you make *any* contribution, as simple as it is, don't forget to add your name (aphabetically sorted)
to the list of contributors in `Code/Contributors.tex`.
