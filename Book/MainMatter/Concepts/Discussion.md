## Discussion

So, to sum it up, here is what we have so far:

* **Skin** and **Mechanics** are the core elements that make up your game.
* **Mechanics** are hard, while a good **skin** is almost always easy to make.
* The easiest (and safest) approach is to **invent skins** but **reuse mechanics**.
* Be **loose** when adding more skin, but **careful** when adding mechanics.
* Always **define your audience** first, and make a game for them.
* Don't be afraid to **polarize players**.

In the next chapter we'll discuss about the phases of game development, and how to tackle you first few projects in a way that doesn't destroy your ego.
